# Feedo Platform - Intelligent Application Management Platform

## Project Overview

Feedo is a comprehensive application management platform built with React that helps users track and manage various opportunities and applications. The platform features a modern, responsive design with interactive components and real-time updates.


## Best Practices Implementation

### 1. Component Organization
- **Modular Structure**: Components are organized by feature/page with dedicated folders
- **Section-Based Architecture**: Each page is divided into logical sections for better maintainability
- **Reusable Components**: Common UI elements are extracted into the components directory

### 2. Styling Architecture
- **CSS Organization**:
  - Component-specific CSS files
  - Comprehensive documentation in CSS files
  - Consistent naming conventions
  - Tailwind CSS integration for utility-first styling
  - CSS modules for component scoping

### 3. State Management
- Firebase integration for backend services
- Local state management using React hooks
- Persistent storage using localStorage where appropriate

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Code splitting by route
- Lazy loading of components
- Optimized animations using CSS transitions
- Efficient rendering with proper React practices
